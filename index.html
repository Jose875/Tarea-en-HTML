	<h1> <p style="color:#C8C0C0";>Curriculum Vitae Using HTML and CSS (Homework #1)</p></h1>

	<h3><p style="color:#BD9E9E";>
This was my first document created in my whole life.
<br>
The first task was to create a curriculum vitae, applying what was learned in class, using HTML</p>
<p style="color:#BD9E9E";>
Taking advantage of the opportunity I made the curriculum vitae about me.
putting my personal information, my academic studies and my work experiences
<p style="color:#BD9E9E";>
I made use of some of the syntax learned in class
</p></h3>
<article style="color:#EA8E8E";>"HTML is a programming language that is used for the development of Internet pages. It is the acronym that correspond to HyperText Markup Language, that is, Hypertext Markup Language ".</article>
<aside style="color:#EA8E8E";>
	However, this type of definition does not tell us much because the definition is technical. For some people to read this, think that HTML includes the graphic design of web pages, however, that is not true as HTML only serves to indicate how the content of a web page is ordered. It does this by means of hypertext marks, which are labels known in English as tags.
</aside>

<h3> <p style="color:#BD9E9E";>
This is an example of how I got my curriculum vitae, so I'll upload it to Github so they can see it and give me their opinions,
I want to remind you this is my first document, my first steps as a programmer

Thanks to the CSS we are much more owners of the final results of the page, being able to do many things that could not be done using only HTML, such as including margins, fonts, backgrounds, colors ...
			<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, in Spanish Cascading Style Sheets.</p></h3>

	<h3><p style="color:#E9E67C ">The box model is the basis of web design - each element is represented as a rectangular box, with its content, padding (interior space), border and margin built on top of each other like the layers of an onion. The browser, to interpret the design of a page, processes the styles that will be applied to each box, the size of the layers of the onion and the location of some boxes with respect to others.</p></h3>

<article style="color:#75FF31";><h3>One of the most powerful features of style sheet programming is to define the styles of a whole website. This is achieved by creating a file where we only place the style declarations of the page and linking all the pages of the site with that file. In this way, all the pages share the same style declaration and, therefore, if we change it, all the pages will change.</h3></article>
<aside style="color:#75FF31";>
	Cascading Style Sheets are written within the HTML code of the web page, only in advanced cases can be written in a separate file and link the page with that file. In the beginning we will use the most direct way to apply styles to the elements of the page,
</aside>

<h3> <p style="color:#75FF31";>
on HTML we define the color of the links in the body tag, with the attributes link, vlink and alink. This allows us to change the color of the links for the entire document, but what if we want to change the color of a specific link, so that it has another color than the one defined in the body tag?

		<h3><p style="color:#5BC5C4 ">JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to perform complex activities on a web page - more and more a web page does more than just display static information - such as displaying content updates at the moment, interacting with maps, 2D / 3D graphic animations etc.
			<br>
The JavaScript language is executed by the JavaScript browser engine, after the HTML and CSS code have been gathered and gathered within the Web page. This ensures that the style and structure of the page are in place at the time that JavaScript begins to run.</p></h3>

	<h3><p style="color:#5BC5C4 ">This is a very good thing, something very common in the use of JavaScript to dynamically modify the HTML and CSS code, so that the user interface is updated, using DOM or the document object model (as mentioned above). If when loading JavaScript and trying to make it work before the HTML and CSS code is read, it will be affected, causing programming errors.</p></h3>

In general terms, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by external code (or internal in case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function consists of a sequence of statements, which make up the so-called body of the function. You can pass values ​​to a function, and the function can return a value.</h3></article>

<article style="color:#EA94C2";>The benefit of using responsive design on a website is mainly that the website automatically adapts to the device from which it is accessed. What I use most often, and which I personally like the most, is the use of media queries, which is a CSS3 module that allows the representation of content to adapt to conditions such as the resolution of the screen and if you work the dimensions of your content in percentages, you can have a very fluid web capable of adapting to almost any size automatically.</article>

<h3> <p style="color:#EA94C2";>
The website automatically adapts to the size of a PC, a Tablet or another device. This technique of design and development is known as "responsive design" or adaptive design.

My favorite workshop using PHP (Homework #8)</p></h1>

		<h3><p style="color:#F9102C ">The eighth homework was to modify task number seven by inserting PHP and use a local server to verify that everything worked very well.
The main idea of ​​the task was that the web page had a section of queries which the user would fill out and at the time of sending the request to our mail, a notice would arrive that the form had been received.</p></h3>

	<article>
		<h3><p style="color:#CF747F ">PHP is the acronym for Hipertext Preprocessor. It is a free and platform-independent server-side programming language, fast, with a large library of functions and a lot of documentation.
			<br>
A server-side language is one that runs on the web server, just before the page is sent over the Internet to the client. The pages that run on the server can perform access to databases, network connections, and other tasks to create the final page that the client will see. The client only receives a page with the HTML code resulting from the execution of the PHP. Since the resulting page contains only HTML code, it is compatible with all browsers.</p></h3>
	</article>
	<h3><p style="color:#CF747F ">PHP, in the case of being mounted on a Linux or Unix server, is faster than ASP, since it runs in a single memory space and this prevents communications between COM components that are made between all the technologies involved in a page ASP.</p></h3>

	<section>
		<h3><p style="color:#CF747F">
Finally we pointed out the security, in this point it is also important the fact that in many cases PHP is installed on Unix or Linux servers, which are better known as faster and safer than the operating system where ASP runs, Windows NT or 2000. In addition, PHP allows you to configure the server to allow or reject different uses, which can make the language more or less secure depending on the needs of each.
